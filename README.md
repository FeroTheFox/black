# fero styles
The things I use don't usually look the way I want them to, but thanks to the power of the web, we can change that!

This repo provides a central place for me to place themes and codesnippets to style them. While most of these focus on reducing distractions, adding spacing, and increasing contrast, some are more focused on QOL and general aesthetics. Some styles may also inadvertantly affect others in ways you don't expect, but I try to minimize that as much as possible.
